LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell u_eval_fw/commalink/count_10/cnt_v[3]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) u_eval_fw/commalink/count_10/cnt_v_reg[0]/CLR, u_eval_fw/commalink/count_10/cnt_v_reg[1]/CLR, u_eval_fw/commalink/count_10/cnt_v_reg[2]/CLR, u_eval_fw/commalink/count_10/cnt_v_reg[3]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks sys_clk_pin and clk_fpga_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks sys_clk_pin] -to [get_clocks clk_fpga_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks sys_clk_pin and clk_fpga_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks sys_clk_pin] -to [get_clocks clk_fpga_0]
